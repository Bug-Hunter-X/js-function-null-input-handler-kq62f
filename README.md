# JavaScript Function Bug: Incorrect Null Handling

This repository demonstrates a common bug in JavaScript functions: incorrect handling of null or undefined inputs.  The `foo` function is intended to add two numbers, but it returns 0 when either input is null. This behavior might be unexpected and could lead to incorrect results in applications.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.js` file offers a corrected version that handles null values appropriately.
